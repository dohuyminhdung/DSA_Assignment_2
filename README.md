# DSA_Assignment_2
# Data Structures and Algorithms asignment 2 from HCMUT, semester 232. 
The assignment focuses on a machine learning topic which involves predicting a number from its image using the kNN algorithm. 
Unlike Assignment 1, this assignment requires the implementation of problem-solving techniques with tree data structures and their related algorithms instead of using linked-lists. Please read Assignment 1 first if you are interested but do not fully understand all the concepts covered in this assignment.
This code passes all relevant algorithms tests and throws error sentences when it encounters logic errors.
